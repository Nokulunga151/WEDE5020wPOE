      <b>Instructions for Croissant Recipe</b>
      <br>
      1.We begin making the Croissant Recipe by making the butter log first. Use the unsalted butter which hard and cut them into small cubes.
      <br><br>
      2.Spread them on a cling film and wrap it in such a way the u can roll it flat. Using rolling pin roll the butter into a rectangular shape about 2 centimeter thick. Make sure u do this quickly otherwise the butter will melt quickly.
      <br><br>
      3.Place the rolled butter in the cling film itself and keep it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
      <br><br>
      4.In the meanwhile make the dough, add all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Using your hand create a crumble texture with the dough by mixing the flour and butter together.
      <br><br>
      5.Slowly add water and knead it into a soft dough, keep it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Once done take out the dough and start rolling it into a rectangular shape so you can wrap the rectangular butter log with this dough.
      <br><br>
      6.Once it is rolled, take out the butter and place it in the center, fold in and wrap the butter inside make sure you seal all openings by just pinching the dough.
      <br><br>
      7.After sealing, gently roll the dough keeping the rectangular shape intact. Keep dusting flour on the dough and rolling it so that it does not stick. Keep edges straight and even. Don’t overwork the dough.
      <br><br>
      8.Roll it into a long rectangular shape about 20 cm length  to 10 cm  breadth, keep the long length facing towards you, fold the left side to the middle and the right side as well, so that the two edges meet the center.
      <br><br>
      9.Now fold it like a book and dust some more flour and refrigerate by covering it with a cling film for 10 minutes.
      <br><br>
      10.Repeat the process around 5 times, make sure you refrigerate the dough every time you do the book folding. Keep the edges straight and do not over work it.
      <br><br>
      11.In the meanwhile, pre-heat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius and keep it ready for baking.
      <br><br>
       In order to make the croissant shapes
       <br><br><br>
      1.Once you have done with the process, roll it to a thickness of about 2-centimeter. Then start cutting into long edged triangles.
      <br><br>
      2.Keep the base of the triangle facing towards you and using a knife cut 1/2 inch in the middle of the base, and start rolling from the base till the tip of the triangle. Press the tip slightly so that it gets sealed.
      <br><br>
      3.Refrigerate it again for 10 more minutes and then bring them out, coat it with milk using a pastry brush.
      <br><br>
      4.Bake it at 200 degree Celsius for 15 minutes, then later bring them out and coat it with little honey so that it gives a nice color to the croissant and bake it for 5 more minutes again.
    <br><br>
      5.Serve the Croissant for a delicious breakfast in the morning along with a cup of Tea.
